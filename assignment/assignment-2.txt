	b. all 4 methods return an int
3. compile the library
NOTE: NO console clas usage in the library

4. in the same solution add a console application
5. add reference to the library application in the same solution
6. use the namespace
7. create instance of Calculation class
8. call all 4 methods
	a. show a menu to the user		
	c. accordingly call any of the 4 methods
	d. before that, accept two values from user and pass them to any of the methods
	e. after one cycle ask user whether to continue or not...


	1. Add
	2. Sub...
	3. Mul...
	4. Div...

	b. tell user to make a choice (1/2/3/4)

	Enter your choice[1/2/3/4]: <1/2/3/4>
	
	Enter 1st value: <10/20/...>
	Enter 2nd value: <10/20/...>

	Result of addition of <num1> & <num2> is <res>
	Would you like to continue?[y/n]: <y/n/Y/N>
	
	1. Add
	2. Sub...
	3. Mul...
	4. Div...

	b. tell user to make a choice (1/2/3/4)

	Enter your choice[1/2/3/4]: <1/2/3/4>
	
	Enter 1st value: <10/20/...>
	Enter 2nd value: <10/20/...>

	Result of addition of <num1> & <num2> is <res>
