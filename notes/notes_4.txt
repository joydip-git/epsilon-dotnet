Employee()

1. with the name CLR looks inside the class
2. finds out how many data members have been declared and their data types
3. starts allocating memory blocks for those data members 
4. invokes ctor and get the values assigned
5. heap pointer is adjusted to the next available memory location after all the above are done
6. now CLR will return the initial address of the "object's" memory (new)

SOLID:
Open Close Pronciple

class Product -- id, name, price, description
